Surface Duo combines the absolute best of Microsoft with the absolute best of Android into one product.

It brings together the power of Microsoft 365 experiences and the full ecosystem of Android mobile apps into one device, with two screens that you can take anywhere.

These groundbreaking experiences are packaged into a robust and sleek industrial design that is synonymous with Surface. It is the thinnest mobile device on the market.

Duo enables you to be more productive, either by spanning one app across the dual 5.6-inch PixelSense Fusion displays or by using two apps at the same time and multitasking across them.

As part of my role on SwiftKey keyboard, I worked with the team to adapt and tailor our typing experience to this brand new form factor. Input is one of the most critical experiences on any device and so it was essential that we got it right.

SwiftKey is able to adapt to every single one of the modes this device supports -- from single mode to dual mode in both portrait and landscape orientations that are a category first.

We spent a lot of time researching how people react to and use SwiftKey on this device. This was crucial to our design process, more so than usual due to the new nature of the form factor.

I also had to opportunity to collaborate closely with the Surface design team themselves to craft tailor-made software experiences that work beautifully in any posture.
