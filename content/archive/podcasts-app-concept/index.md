This project focused on building a lightweight and modern podcast consumption app. While there are many great third-party podcasting apps on Windows, thereâ€™s no solution built into the OSâ€”this app aims to fill that void.

## Listen now

This is the first page the user sees when the app is opened. Theyâ€™re presented with a collection of some of the podcast episodes they havenâ€™t listened to.

Below this are suggested podcasts that the user might enjoy. They can subscribe to the podcast directly from this page, or click on one to view it in more detail.

Connected animations are used in the transition between pages in this app, helping the user remain aware of context and where items will return to when the back button is pressed.

Once on a podcast info pageâ€”the user can select an episode to play or get more info by right-clicking. This context menu provides options to not only play the content, but also download it to device for offline listening, getting more details, sharing the episode, or reporting it for inappropriate content.

## Search

There is a search box on the right side of the navigation bar, which (rather obviously) searches the catalog of available podcasts. The top three recent searches are shown first (this history can be cleared and/or turned off in the appâ€™s settings), then trending searches are shownâ€”potentially helping users discover new content based around what other people are listening to.

Finally, on certain pages there may be an option to only search in the context of that page. On this podcast info page, toggling that option would mean only that podcastâ€™s episodes would be searched.

## Exploring new podcasts

Under the **Explore** tab, users can discover new podcastsâ€”with both curated selections and suggestions based upon listening history.

Users can also browse by featured podcasts publishers/providers or by category.

## Video

As well as audio podcasts, users can access and play video-based podcasts.

Video podcasts can also be set to display in the corner over the userâ€™s other windows (CompactOverlay mode).

## Multitasking

Above I mentioned how video podcasts can be run in CompactOverlay mode, however they are not the only podcast type to do so. Audio podcasts may also be shrunk down into a persistent floating window, allowing the user to work while still having quick access to playback controls.

For example, here the user is sending a message to a friend using the Your Phone app and the Podcasts app window has shrunk to the top-right corner of the screen. It uses colored Acrylic material, the color being automatically picked by the artwork of the podcast.

## Final remarks

This new Podcasts app gives users a simple way of listening and managing podcastsâ€”both audio and video. Smooth animations and a clean design help keep users engaged. CompactOverlay support makes it easy to multitask while still keeping an eye on whatâ€™s playing.
