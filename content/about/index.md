I'm a self-taught designer-developer (yep, that's a thing!) specializing in simple and effortless experiences for both the devices we use today and the ones weâ€™ll use in the future. Crafting high-quality products is my passion, and I work tirelessly to achieve that goal.

Using the medium of motion I bring these experiences to life, visualizing the smallest interactions to entire user journeys.

I strongly believe in open design, and encourage co-creation that can help deliver a better solution for our users.

Accessibility and inclusion sit at the center of my process â€” nobody should be left with a subpar experience.

Currently taking a break. Previously design intern at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) working on a variety of products and design systems, and freelance before that. Awarded 2018-19 [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/) (Most Valuable Professional) for Windows Design.
