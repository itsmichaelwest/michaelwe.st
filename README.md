Welcome to my home on the internet.

## Build instructions

This site is built with Next.js. You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/) and npm.

1. Clone this repository. I use Git LFS to store image files, so you may need to configure your copy of Git to work with this.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. To preview the site, run `npm run dev` and then go to `localhost:3000`.
4. To build a production deploy, run `npm run build` then `npm run start` and go to `localhost:3000`.
