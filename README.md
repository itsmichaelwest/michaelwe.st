Welcome to my home on the internet. 

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/cb0e3314-e6c0-4a14-873d-eb18f6bc5b75/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/michaelwest-portfolio/deploys)

## Build instructions

This site is built with Gatsby. You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/).

1. Clone this repository. I use Git LFS to store image files, so you may need to configure your copy of Git to work with this.
2. Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
3. To preview the site, run `gatsby develop` and then go to `localhost:8000`.
4. To build a production deploy, run `gatsby build` then `gatsby serve` and go to `localhost:9000`.
